A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate cheats and hacks. For example, you can use a trainer to unlock all cars in Need for Speed: Underground 2 for free, without having to complete the career mode or buy them with in-game currency. This way, you can enjoy driving any car you want and experiment with different combinations of parts and styles.
 
There are several trainers available for Need for Speed: Underground 2, but one of the most popular ones is the Mega Pack trainer by PiZZADOX[^1^]. This trainer has 10 options that you can toggle on and off with hotkeys, such as infinite nitro, instant cooldown, always win race, and more. But the most important option is the unlock all cars option, which does exactly what it says.
 
To use this trainer, you need to download it from a reliable source[^1^] and extract it to your game folder. Then, run the trainer.exe file and start the game. You will hear a beep sound when the trainer is activated. To unlock all cars, press F6 while in the main menu or garage. You will see a message saying "All Cars Unlocked". Now you can select any car from the car lot or customize mode.
