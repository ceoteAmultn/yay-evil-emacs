# How to Use SAM Mechanism Software for Design and Analysis
 
SAM Mechanism Software is a powerful tool for designing, simulating and optimizing planar mechanisms and drive systems. It can help you create complex mechanisms with various elements, such as beams, sliders, springs, belts, gears, rack-and-pinions, non-linear springs, curved sliders and more. You can also perform kinematic and kinetic analysis of your mechanisms, such as positions, velocities, accelerations, forces and torques. Moreover, you can optimize your mechanism design by adjusting multiple parameters and objectives, such as driving torque, path or function.

In this article, we will show you how to use SAM Mechanism Software for design and analysis of a simple four-bar linkage mechanism. We will cover the following steps:
 
- Running a sample project
- Building a new mechanism
- Graphical construction of a mechanism
- Two position synthesis of a four-bar linkage mechanism
- Input motion and analysis results
- Optimization of driving torque

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of how to use SAM Mechanism Software for your own projects. Let's get started!
  
## Running a sample project
 
The easiest way to learn how to use SAM Mechanism Software is to run a sample project that comes with the software. You can find many examples of different types of mechanisms and drive systems in the Examples folder. For this tutorial, we will use the example called "4bar\_2pos\_synth.sam", which is located in the folder "Examples\Design Wizards\4-bar mechanisms". This example shows how to synthesize a four-bar linkage mechanism that passes through two given positions.
 
To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Open SAM Mechanism Software and click on File -> Open.
2. Browse to the folder "Examples\Design Wizards\4-bar mechanisms" and select the file "4bar\_2pos\_synth.sam". Click on Open.
3. You will see the main window of SAM Mechanism Software with the graphical representation of the mechanism on the left and the input data on the right. You can zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel or the buttons on the toolbar. You can also pan by holding down the right mouse button and dragging.
4. To run the simulation, click on Run -> Run Simulation or press F5. You will see the mechanism move according to the input motion. You can pause or stop the simulation by clicking on Run -> Pause Simulation or Run -> Stop Simulation.
5. To view the analysis results, click on Results -> Show Results Window or press F6. You will see a new window with various tabs for different types of results. You can select which results you want to display by checking or unchecking the boxes on the left. You can also export the results to a text file by clicking on File -> Export Results.

## Building a new mechanism
 
Now that you have seen how to run a sample project, let's try to build our own mechanism from scratch. We will create a simple four-bar linkage mechanism that has one fixed link (ground), one input link (crank), one output link (rocker) and one coupler link. The input link will be driven by an angle function that varies linearly from 0 to 360 degrees.
 
To build a new mechanism, follow these steps:

1. Click on File -> New or press Ctrl+N to create a new project.
2. You will see an empty workspace with only one element: ground (G). This element represents the fixed reference frame for your mechanism. You can move it by dragging it with the left mouse button or rotate it by dragging it with the right mouse button.
3. To add a new element, click on Elements -> Add Element or press Ctrl+E. You will see a dialog box where you can choose which type of element you want to add. For this tutorial, we will use only beam elements, which are rigid links that connect two nodes.
4. Select Beam from the list and click on OK. You will see a new beam element (B1) attached to ground (G). You can move it by 8cf37b1e13
